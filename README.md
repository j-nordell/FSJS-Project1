# Project 1 - Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree
## Project instructions

- [] Create an array of JavaScript objects to hold the data for your quotes. Name the array quotes. The quotes array should be accessible in the global scope.

- [] Each quote object in the quotes array should have the following properties:
    - A quote property which contains a string: the text of the quote that will be displayed on the page.
    - A source property which contains a string identifying the creator of the quote. For example: "Mark Twain" or "Traditional Irish proverb.‚Äù
    - An optional citation property which contains a string identifying where the quote comes from, like a speech or publication. For example, "Famous Anonymous Jokes." If there is no known publication, do not include this property on the object.
    - An optional year property which contains a number identifying the date of the quote. For example, 1997. If there is no known date, then do not include this property on the object.
- [] Create a function named getRandomQuote which:
    - selects a random quote object from the quotes array
    - returns the randomly selected quote object

- [] Create a function named printQuote which follows these rules:
    - printQuote calls the getRandomQuote function and stores the returned quote object in a variable
    - printQuote constructs a string containing the different properties of the quote object using the following HTML template:

```html

<p class="quote"> [quote here] </p>
<p class="source"> [source here]
  <span class="citation"> [citation here] </span>
  <span class="year"> [year here] </span>
</p>

```
- (list continued)
    - printQuote doesn't add a for a missing citation or a if the year property is missing
    - printQuote displays the final HTML string to the page. You can use this JS snippet to accomplish that: document.getElementById('quote-box').innerHTML

- [] Add comments to your code.
